Date:11/6/17

Created as a project for college course to show a list of favorites.  
The challenges are the list of favorites that kids can choose from.

Main page actions: 
Click on New! to have left panel expand 
Click on Home to display overview of goal for application (back button returns to Main)
Click on Challenges where user can enter in a name of an activity and filtered search will return match. (back button returns to Main)
I was going to add internal or external links on Challenges to be more descriptive but haven't yet.
Click on Sign Up to display a form page where the kids can sign up and explain medical issues.  (back button returns to Main)
I was going to add additional information for parent/guardian information but haven't yet.
Click on Favorites to allow user to rank challenges to what they feel is best to worst and this will save their comments. (back button returns to Main)
Click on Personalities to just have some fun and show users different emojis for personality types.  It was used to show that I understand how to create a grid.  
I was going to add more details on each personality but haven't yet.

Left panel actions:
Lists out new challeges with links to external websites

Themes:
Used ThemeRoller with 3 swatches to demonstrate that I can add new themes to my web application.
